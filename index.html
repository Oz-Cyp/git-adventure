        <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
        <p>Git is a version control system that allows collaboration between developers.</p>
        <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
        <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. ... As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically. Note. The “master” branch in Git is not a special branch.</p>
        <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
        <p>The working tree is the folder where the repo is initialised(which includes all the subdirectories and files).</p>
        <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
        <p>The staging area is the area that holds all the files we’re ready to commit and push to the repository.</p>
        <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote server?</h4>
        <p>git pull</p>
